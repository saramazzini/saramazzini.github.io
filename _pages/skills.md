## <span style="color: #307D7E"> **Data**  </span> 

* Designed and conducted over five hypothesis-based research projects (**A/B testing**), resulting in two scientific articles, one scientific review, and one methodological publication.
* Created reproducible automatic **programming** scripts in **R** and **MATLAB** to process and analyze complex multidimensional datasets, including data wrangling, signal processing and statistics (cluster-based permutation tests, linear mixed models, bayesian t-test). 
* Created **compelling graphs** and images using R and MATLAB to visualize complex datasets and facilitate clearer understanding of results shared at international scientific conferences and in scientific journals.
* Drew insights from **data analysis** to shape follow-up research directions and deepen the scientific understanding of brain and behavior.


## <span style="color: #307D7E"> **Communication**  </span> 

* Developed strong **scientific communication** skills by writing three experimental theses (Bachelor, Master, and PhD), which contributed to four peer-reviewed scientific publications.
* Demonstrated **audience engagement** by presenting posters at over seven national and international scientific conferences.
Applied presentation skills and storytelling by preparing and delivering regular presentations within research groups and external institutions, effectively engaging diverse audiences.
* Managed **digital communication** channels (X and Slack) to coordinate communication for a scientific conference.
* Translated complex science into accessible language through blog posts, showcasing **storytelling** and scientific communication skills.
* Created **compelling visuals** for scientific publications, presentations, and blog posts to enhance understanding and engagement.
* Utilized **intercultural communication** skills by working professionally in four European languages (from intermediate to advanced proficiency across five languages).
* Fostered **effective communication** within research teams and served as a PhD representative, mediating dialogue between researchers and institute stakeholders.


## <span style="color: #307D7E"> **Project management**  </span> 

* Demonstrated **event organization** skills by co-organizing a hybrid scientific conference with 100 in-person attendees, managing **budgeting**, **scheduling**, hospitality, and digital communication with participants.
* Applied **strategic planning** and scheduling by coordinating multiple projects throughout my PhD, including my own research, team initiatives, and extracurricular activities.
* Exercised **leadership** and a **collaborative mindset** by mentoring several internship and Master’s thesis students, guiding them to successfully complete projects while meeting academic requirements.
* Utilized **time management** skills by tracking and planning PhD project tasks over four years using Gantt charts, ensuring timely project completion.
* Employed **critical thinking** and **problem-solving** throughout research activities to overcome challenges and adapt plans as needed.

### Current project: *The role of intra- and inter-brain neural synchrony in face-to-face communication*
Synchronized neural oscillations are thought to be relevant for selecting and transferring information within and between cortical areas. In particular, neural synchrony seems to facilitate the integration of stimuli coming from different sensory modalities. In the recent years, neural synchrony has not only been investigated within a brain (intra-brain synchrony), but also between brains (inter-brain synchrony) while individuals engage in social interactions.
During face-to-face communication, auditory and visual information (i.e. speech and gestures) need to be integrated into a meaningful message and this process is likely driven by neural synchrony between the cortical areas involved. Nonetheless, the role of neural synchrony during natural conversation is not clear yet. Namely, it is still unknown whether intra- and inter-brain synchrony is necessary and/or beneficial for effective face-to-face communication. Within this project, we will test the hypothesis whether neural synchrony plays a mechanistic role in integrating different sources of information within and between conversational partners. More specifically, we aim to unravel whether  intra- and inter-brain neural synchrony is necessary, or even required for, successful communication. 


### *Oscillatory correlates of syntactic encoding: a comparison between classic galactosemia patients and healthy subjects* (Master thesis)

Language is a fundamental and unique aspect of human cognition: it is used in every dayâ€™s life to share thoughts, opinions and intentions.
Classic galactosemia (CG) is a rare metabolic disease characterized by a wide range of cognitive deficits, among which language production. CG patients commonly undergo speech therapy in order to improve articulation; however, it is still not clear if their deficit is originated from a motor-speech or a language planning failure.
CG brain functioning has been studied with several neuroimaging techniques, which reported both structural and functional impairments. However, the oscillatory dynamics of language production have not yet been investigated in CG patients.
In the present study, the oscillatory correlates of syntactic encoding were studied both in healthy controls and in CG patients during language production. In the study, the neural activity of 21 CG patients and 19 healthy controls was recorded with electroencephalography (EEG) while participants performed a language production task. More specifically, participants had to describe a visually animated scene with two levels of syntactic complexity. A power spectrum and a time-frequency analysis were performed to compare the oscillatory dynamics of CG patients and healthy controls across the two syntactic conditions.

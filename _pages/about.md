<span style="color: #307D7E"> **Hello! I am Sara Mazzini, welcome to my website!** </span>  

I am currently a PhD student in  [The Communicative Brain Group](https://www.mpi.nl/department/communicative-brain/21) at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics. I have always been fascinated by languages and by how these are processed in the brain. Besides the curiosity for the neurobiological basis of language, I am intrigued by neural oscillations and their role in human cognition. 
Especially, how do neural oscillations support language processing and production in real-life communication? 
Within my PhD studies, I am investigating the role of neural synchrony both within and between conversational partners in naturalistic face-to-face communication using dual-EEG. 

Previous to the start of my PhD, I obtained a Bachelor in Psychology (2018) at the University of Bologna and a Research Master in Cognitive Neuroscience (2020) at Maastricht University. 
Moreover, I worked as a research assistant for the Brain & Language Group at the Maastricht Brain Imaging Centre. In my previous research, I focused on the neural oscillations supporting language production in both typical
and atypical populations, using EEG and non-invasive brain stimulation.

Besides research, I particularly enjoy getting involved in extra-curricular activities: I was a writer and editor at the MPITalkling, the institute's science blog about language, I co-organized the IMPRS Conference 2022 and I covered the role of external PhD representative of the institute.

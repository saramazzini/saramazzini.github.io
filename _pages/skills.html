## Data
* Designed and conducted over five hypothesis-based research projects (**A/B testing**), resulting in two scientific articles, one scientific review, and one methodological publication.
* Created reproducible automatic **programming** scripts in **R** and **MATLAB** to process and analyze complex multidimensional datasets, including data wrangling, signal processing and statistics (cluster-based permutation tests, linear mixed models, bayesian t-test). 
* Created compelling graphs and images using R and MATLAB to **visualize complex datasets** and facilitate clearer understanding of results shared at international scientific conferences and in scientific journals.
* Drew insights from **data analysis** to shape follow-up research directions and deepen the scientific understanding of brain and behavior.

## Communication
* Developed strong **scientific communication** skills by writing three experimental theses (Bachelor, Master, and PhD), which contributed to four peer-reviewed scientific publications.
* Demonstrated **audience engagement** by presenting posters at over seven national and international scientific conferences.
* Applied **presentation skills** and **storytelling** by preparing and delivering regular presentations within research groups and external institutions, effectively engaging diverse audiences.
* Managed **digital communication** channels (Twitter and Slack) to coordinate communication for a scientific conference.
* **Translated complex science** into accessible language through blog posts, showcasing **storytelling** and scientific communication skills.
* Created **compelling visuals** for scientific publications, presentations, and blog posts to enhance understanding and engagement.
* Utilized **intercultural communication** skills by working professionally in four European languages (from intermediate to advanced proficiency across five languages).
* Fostered **effective communication** within research teams and served as a PhD representative, mediating dialogue between researchers and institute **stakeholders**.

## Project management

* Demonstrated **event organization** skills by co-organizing a hybrid scientific conference with 100 in-person attendees, managing **budgeting**, scheduling, hospitality, and digital communication with attendees.
* Applied **strategic planning** and scheduling by coordinating multiple projects throughout my PhD, including my own research, team initiatives, and extracurricular activities.
* Exercised **leadership** and a **collaborative mindset** by mentoring several internship and master’s thesis students, guiding them to successfully complete projects while meeting academic requirements.
* Utilized **time management** skills by tracking and planning PhD project tasks over four years using Gantt charts, ensuring timely project completion.
* Employed **critical thinking** and **problem-solving** throughout research activities to overcome challenges and adapt plans as needed.

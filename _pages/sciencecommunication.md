Driven by a strong motivation to make science accessible and fun for everyone, I engaged in science communication throughout my PhD, mostly by writing blog posts on topics related to the brain and language. 
I contributed to [MPI TalkLing](https://www.mpi-talkling.mpi.nl/?page_id=56&lang=en) as a writer and editor, aiming to engage high-school students and other audiences and spark their interest in language science and possible career paths in the field. 
In addition, I wrote for [Het Talige Brein](https://taalenhersenen.wordpress.com/), a blog designed to share the research conducted within the Neurobiology of Language department at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics.
